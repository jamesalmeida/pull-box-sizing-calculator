# Claude Context - Pull Box Sizing Calculator

## Purpose

This file stores session information between Claude Code sessions to provide context for future conversations. Before closing a session, key progress, decisions, and context should be added here to maintain continuity in the next session. Sessions should be added to the log like a journal. Previous sessions should be retained by default.

## Session History

### Session 1: 2025-07-16
**Session Duration**: Extended session  
**Session Type**: Framework setup and initialization

#### Activities Completed:
1. **Framework Setup**: Executed complete template setup process, converting all TEMPLATE files to project-specific versions
2. **Project Analysis**: Analyzed existing codebase structure including script.js, index.html, README.md
3. **Documentation Creation**: Created customized dev/ framework files (app-framework.md, claude.md, claude-context.md, progress.md)

#### Key Findings:
- Project is a fully functional 3D pull box sizing calculator using Three.js
- NEC Article 314.28 compliance calculations already implemented
- Static deployment via GitHub Pages with no build process required
- Client-side only application with localStorage persistence

#### Decisions Made:
- Established dev/ directory framework for project management
- Documented complete technical architecture in app-framework.md
- Set up session tracking system for future Claude Code interactions

#### Session Outcome:
- Framework setup complete - all templates customized for Pull Box Sizing Calculator
- Project ready for continued development with proper documentation structure
- Clear development workflow established for future sessions

## Key Information to Preserve

### Technical Decisions
- Three.js chosen for 3D visualization with WebGL rendering
- Vanilla JavaScript architecture without build tools or frameworks
- NEC Article 314.28 compliance as core requirement for all calculations
- Client-side only design for maximum compatibility and deployment simplicity

### Known Issues
- No specific issues identified during setup
- WebGL compatibility should be monitored across browser versions
- Mobile touch interactions may need optimization testing

### Development Patterns
- Modular JavaScript functions organized by functionality
- Three.js scene management following standard patterns
- LocalStorage for data persistence between sessions
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS utility classes
