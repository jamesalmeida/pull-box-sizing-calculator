## Current Roadmap

### Next Session Priorities
1. Performance optimization for complex 3D scenes
2. Accessibility improvements (keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
3. Mobile touch interaction refinements

### Upcoming Milestones
- Mobile optimization completion - 2025-07-20
- Accessibility compliance - 2025-07-25
- Performance monitoring integration - 2025-08-01

### Issues to Address
- No critical issues currently identified
- Monitor WebGL performance on lower-end devices
- Consider adding unit tests for calculation functions

## Session Log

### Session 1 (2025-07-16)
**Accomplished**:
- Completed framework setup with all template customization
- Analyzed existing fully-functional application
- Established development documentation structure

**Current State**: 
- Application is production-ready and deployed
- All core features implemented and working
- Development framework established for future enhancements

**Technical Implementation Notes**:
- Three.js integration complete with optimized scene management
- NEC Article 314.28 calculations accurately implemented
- Responsive design working across desktop and mobile browsers

## Technical Requirements Summary

**Tech Stack**: 
- Three.js for 3D graphics and WebGL rendering
- Tailwind CSS for responsive styling
- Vanilla JavaScript for core functionality
- HTML5 Canvas for 3D visualization
- LocalStorage API for data persistence

**Key Features**:
- Interactive 3D pull box visualization with draggable conduits
- NEC Article 314.28 compliant dimensional calculations
- Support for straight pulls, angle pulls, U-pulls, and rear wall pulls
- Real-time validation and warning system
- Persistent data storage between sessions

**Architecture**:
Client-side single-page application with modular JavaScript functions, Three.js scene management, and responsive UI design. No backend required - all calculations performed in browser.

## Implementation Notes

### Code Architecture
Modular JavaScript architecture with separate functions for 3D scene management, NEC calculations, UI interactions, and data persistence. Three.js scene initialized once with efficient object updates for real-time interaction.

### Key Functions/Components
- `initThreeJS()`: Scene, camera, and renderer initialization
- `calculateMinimumDimensions()`: NEC Article 314.28 compliance calculations
- `updatePullsTable()`: DOM manipulation for pull management interface
- `savePullsToStorage()`: LocalStorage data persistence

### Database Schema (if applicable)
No database - client-side localStorage stores JSON configuration objects containing pulls array and box dimensions.

### Testing Strategy
Manual testing across browsers with focus on WebGL compatibility, responsive design validation, and NEC calculation accuracy verification.

## Success Criteria

### ‚úÖ Project Success Metrics:
- [x] NEC Article 314.28 calculations implemented correctly
- [x] Interactive 3D visualization functional
- [x] Responsive design works on mobile and desktop
- [x] Production deployment successful

### Quality Standards:
- [x] Code follows consistent JavaScript conventions
